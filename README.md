## Features
    A user must create an account to log in and use the app.
    The form validation will guide you to introduce only accepted data in all of the forms.
    Once logged in, the main page will display a list of 10 movie cards with an input at the very top of the cards. 
    The movies can be filtered based on the title and the list will update as the user type.
    There are separate components diplaying data about each individual movie, director and genre.
    The user has the option to add or remove a movie to a list of favorite movies. The button for add/remove a movie will update its text accordingly, similar to a like/dislike button.
